# Character Types

In C++, `char` is not necessarily the same type as `signed char`, although on most platforms they are equivalent.

The C++ standard defines `char`, `signed char`, and `unsigned char` as three distinct integral types, each with its own range of representable values. The C++ standard does not specify whether `char` is `signed` or `unsigned` by default, which means that it is implementation-defined.

On most platforms, `char` is implemented as a signed type, and its range of representable values is the same as that of `signed char`. However, on some rare platforms, `char` may be implemented as an unsigned type, in which case it would have the same range of representable values as `unsigned char`.

So, while `char` and `signed char` are often the same type in C++, it is not guaranteed by the standard. To ensure portability of code that relies on the signedness of `char`, it is recommended to use `signed char` explicitly.
